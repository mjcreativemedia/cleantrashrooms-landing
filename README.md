# CleanTrashRooms Landing Page

This repository hosts the CleanTrashRooms marketing site built on the Rebow starter design system.

## Quick start

1. Clone the repository and move into the project directory.
2. Serve the static files locally (for example, `python3 -m http.server 3000`) to preview the landing page at `http://localhost:3000`.
3. Update content in `index.html` and replace imagery or styles in the `assets/` directory as needed for marketing updates.

## Deployment notes

The site is designed to be deployed as a static site (e.g., GitHub Pages or any static hosting provider). Ensure the `CNAME` file remains in the project root to preserve the CleanTrashRooms custom domain mapping when deploying.
